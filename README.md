📝 Project Overview
The Madiyan is a whimsical web application designed to help users procrastinate in style. It offers a sarcastic and humorous take on productivity, providing a "Procrastination Timer" that tracks idle time and rewards users with random popups and achievements for doing absolutely nothing. The app features a fake productivity graph and a Hall of Fame to celebrate top procrastinators.

🚨 The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world obsessed with productivity, people often feel pressured to stay focused and efficient. This app addresses the non-existent issue of excessive productivity by encouraging users to embrace idleness and distraction.

💡 The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By providing a platform where doing nothing is the goal, The Madiyan Deluxe offers a playful escape from the constant hustle. Users can enjoy random popups, track their idle time, and even capture selfies to commemorate their procrastination achievements.
